# Radius-Based Nearest Neighbor (NNR) Classifier (Python)

- Implemented a machine learning classifier using a Nearest Neighbor with Radius (NNR) approach with feature scaling, Euclidean distance, and majority voting.
- Tuned the classification radius automatically based on validation accuracy, improving performance on unseen test data.
- Utilized NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, distance computation, and performance evaluation.
